							<p> I wish I could say I always loved writing, but that would certainly be a fabrication. Throughout my adolescence I genuinely disliked it, preferring writing’s more popular cousin: talking. Why? Talking is easy. Talking is fun. Talking doesn't enable you to re-write the same sentence until your brain can no longer derive meaning from words. In summary, writing is a lot of work. </p>

							<p> I eventually changed my tune. I realized that activities—like writing—that require work can actually be really fun (or, at the least, rewarding). In my early 20s, I resumed reading for pleasure, which allowed me to find a love for the written word. While I am not what I would consider a “writer” with a capital W, I do consider myself a thoughtful and experienced writer in the practical sense. </p>

							<p> In my professional life, writing consumes roughly half my day, from project plans to emails to everything in between. In UX research and design—and most professions I suppose—understanding how to communicate to a diverse audience effectively through writing is crucial to the success of any project. </p>

							<p> The purpose of this page is to share writing samples that demonstrate my writing abilities, analytical capacity, and critical thinking aptitude. To access my writings, please reference the table below. </p>
