				<h2>About Me</h2>
			</div>
				<p> Hello and welcome to my resume page! My name is Conner and I am a tech professional with around five years of experience in the industry. Although I am relatively new in my career, I have had a wealth of experiences solving a diverse set of business challenges. In my current work, I partner with leaders at both start-ups and fortune 500 companies on all things marketing. My experience bringing products to market has induced a deep interest in understanding and developing products myself. I am currently focused on expanding my skills in the areas of product design and research, with the goal of becoming a researcher and designer full-time. To meet this objective, I am in the process of attaining a Master of Science in Information Expereince Design at the Pratt Institute, where I am learning the skills required to become a well-rounded UX professional.
