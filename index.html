								<p> <b> Statement of Purpose  </b> </p>
							</div>
							
							<p> Digital technology is an essential tool in building a more equitable and humane world, but technology alone does not improve lives. Progress only occurs when businesses, institutions, and governments approach technology by prioritizing people and their needs. The challenge of humanizing digital technology inspired me to enroll in the Pratt Institute's Master of Science in Information Experience Design (IXD), where I am currently training to become a UX professional. I am passionate about building a world that is more attuned to human experiences and I plan to dedicate my life’s work to developing ethical products that improve the daily lives of people. </p>

							<p> Throughout my time at Uber, Salesforce, and now Google, I have been fortunate enough to work on interesting problems with a wide range of users across a broad set of industries. I have seen firsthand the importance of UX, and its potential to improve the lives of both internal and external users. I have also had the opportunity to acquaint myself with numerous UX professionals, learning from their experiences the rewards and challenges of the profession. </p>

							<p> As a student at the Pratt institute, I am gaining the knowledge and experience necessary to become a UX professional. The IXD program’s ethos – to create better digital experiences through the application of human-centered, ethical approaches to design and research – aligns exactly with my stated goals. Pratt’s emphasis on both theoretical and practical learning is preparing me to become a well-rounded UX professional with the ability to solve problems and contextualize my work within the wider world. </p>

							<p> As part of my first major project in the IXD program, I have made this website from scratch using HTML and CSS, with the hope of creating a space that communicates my experiences, goals, and values. I will continue to share my work here, such as my writings, designs, and research. If you are interested in connecting with me to discuss my experiences, provide feedback on the website, or more – feel free to reach out via email. Thank you for your time and consideration and I hope you enjoy my website! </p>
